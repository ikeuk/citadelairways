set out on the NONNEGOTIABLE Air Waybill, Label, Manifest, or Pick-Up Record (collectively "Shipping Documentation") 
and as appropriate any transportation agreement between Customer and FedEx covering such shipment and in any 
applicable tariff, Service Guide or Standard Conditions of Carriage, copies of which are available upon request, 
and which are incorporated into this Agreement by reference. If there is a conflict between the Shipping Documentation
 and any such document then in effect or this Agreement, the transportation agreement, tariff, Service Guide, Standard
 Conditions of Carriage, or this Agreement will control, in that order of priority. If a shipment originates outside the 
United States, the contract of carriage is with the FedEx subsidiary, branch, or independent contractor who originally

of shipping documentation including import/export forms.</p>
<p>(ii) In the event Customer uses SHIP MANAGER to process shipments tendered to FedEx 
for delivery to locations outside the United States or country of shipment origin, Customer 
will, at Customer's sole expense, assure that the terms and conditions of international carriage 
supplied by FedEx from time to time (and which may be amended or modified from time to time at FedEx's 
sole discretion) are placed on the Shipping Documentation as may be instructed by FedEx, for all such international
 shipments. Customer will defend, indemnify and hold harmless FedEx, its officers, directors, employees and agents from 
and against any and all losses, damages, claims and other items of cost and expense arising out of Customer's failure to 
apply the international carriage terms to the Shipping Documentation for such international shipments, including without 
limitation claims from the recipient of any shipment, and Customer's failure to follow FedEx's instructions in regard to the 
placement of the terms on the Shipping Documentation for such international shipments.</p>
<p>(iii) Printed Signature. Customer acknowledges that if SHIP MANAGER is used to process shipments to locations outside the United States
 or country of shipment origin, Customer must enter the name of the person completing the Shipping Documentation to print in lieu of 
its manual signature on the Shipping Documentation, as applicable, for all shipments tendered by Customer to FedEx using SHIP MANAGER. 
Customer further acknowledges that such printed name shall be sufficient to constitute the Customer's signature, and Customer's acceptance 
of FedEx's terms and conditions of carriage contained in the applicable transportation agreement, tariff, Service Guide, Standard Conditions,
 or Shipping Documentation, under which the shipment is accepted by FedEx, or its independent contractor.</p>
 <p>(iv) Unless otherwise indicated, the shipper's address indicated on the face of any Shipping 
Documentation is the place of execution and the place of departure and the recipient's address 
listed on the face of the Shipping Documentation is the place of destination. Unless otherwise indicated
 on the face of the Shipping Documentation the first carrier of all shipments is FedEx Express, P.O. Box 727,
