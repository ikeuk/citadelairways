	<p class="heading text-center mb-sm-5 mb-4">AirWaysExpress offers standard customs clearance, however, we also offer a comprehensive range of value added solutions when your shipment has special clearance needs. Our ancillary service offerings may be different per country/territory depending on the additional processing that may be required by a local regulatory agency or when you or your importer request special processing from our customs broker. We may assess a service fee to obtain the release of your shipment from any regulatory agency or for special services you may request. We may charge a fee for standard customs clearance service in some countries/territories or in some AirWaysExpress subsidiaries. We may apply and bill these service fees, which are subject to change, to any shipper, recipient or designated third party.
