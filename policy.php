<h5>1. What information does FedEx capture about visitors to its web site?</h5>
<p>The fedex.com web server uses an extended log file format which captures: date and time of visit, referring address (location from which a visitor comes to fedex.com), type of Internet browser, and visitor's IP address (Each computer that connects to the Internet is assigned a unique number, an IP address, for identification purposes). The log file does not capture a visitor's email address.</p>

<h6>3. How does FedEx use the information?</h6>
<p>The information collected through this site helps us identify the type of web site content our customers value most. We use this information to market and improve the web site and our services. We also use this information to send you email notifications about updates to the web site, and to contact you by other means for marketing and other purposes. Our policy is to not give, sell or otherwise distribute the information collected through this site to third parties outside of FedEx Corporation and its subsidiaries (unless required by law); provided, however, in some cases we may use suppliers to assist us in collecting, using or otherwise processing for our benefit the information obtained through this site. Our practice is to require our suppliers to conduct such activities consistent with this policy and our requirements.</p>
<h4>BACK TO TOP</h4>
<h6>4. What happens when I leave fedex.com to visit a FedEx linked web site?</h6>
<p>Parts of fedex.com, such as FedEx Global Trade Manager, consist of products and services hosted by third-party businesses. When you leave fedex.com to visit one of these sites, the only information transferred to the third-party is the fact that you came from fedex.com (the referring address).</p>
<p>This practice allows the third-party to monitor its own web site traffic, but does not provide them with any information about you. FedEx is not responsible or liable for the independent privacy policies of our third-party sites. You should consult the privacy policies at those sites to determine how your information may be used.</p>

<h6>5. What is a cookie?</h6>
<p>A cookie is a series of data characters that, when programmed into a web site, is placed by the web server into the browser's application folder on your computer. Once placed onto your machine, the cookie will allow the web site to "recognize" you as a unique individual.</p>
<h4>BACK TO TOP</h4>
<h6>6. Does FedEx use cookies?</h6>
<p>Cookies are used to achieve two goals. The first is to provide FedEx with the capability to personalize information for certain segments of its customer base. Secondly, in some instances, cookies are used to allow FedEx the opportunity to associate individual customers with their information profiles. For example, through the use of cookies, fedex.com Login can "remember" your user ID when you login to FedEx Ship Manager at fedex.com on your computer.</p>
<h4>BACK TO TOP</h4>
<h6>7. Can cookies be removed from my hard drive?</h6>
<p>Yes, cookies can be removed from your hard drive. Also, depending on what type of web browser and what browser version you are using, you may be able to change the properties on your cookie file so that cookies are not used or saved.
